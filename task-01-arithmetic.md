#  Python Practice Task - Arithmetic Calculator

This is a simple Python practice task to understand and use **arithmetic operators**.

---

##  Task Description

Write a Python program that:

1. Takes **two numbers** as input from the user.
2. Performs the following **arithmetic operations** and prints results:

   - Addition (`+`)
   - Subtraction (`-`)
   - Multiplication (`*`)
   - Division (`/`)
   - Modulus (`%`)
  

---

##  Example Output

```

Enter first number: 15
Enter second number: 4

Arithmetic Operations:
15 + 4 = 19
15 - 4 = 11
15 \* 4 = 60
15 / 4 = 3.75
15 % 4 = 3

```

---

## Objective

The goal of this task is to practice **basic arithmetic operators in Python** and understand how they work with user input.

---

## Next Steps

- Try with different input values.
- Check how the program behaves with **negative numbers** and **decimals**.
- Modify the program to show results in a **formatted way** (e.g., using f-strings).
```
